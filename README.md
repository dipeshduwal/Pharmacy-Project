This repository contains the HTML code for BeeWell Pharmacy, a static webpage for an online pharmacy. The website features essential sections such as home, team, catalog, and contact information. I extensively used Flexbox and related properties in order to design the overall outlay of the project.

**Structure:** <br>
* index.html: The main static HTML file containing the structure and content. <br>
* styles.css: External stylesheet managing the layout, colors, and responsive design. <br>
* /images: Directory containing pharmacy logos and promotional icons.

**Features:** <br>
* Navigation Menu: Quick links to Home, Team, Catalog, and Contact sections. <br>
* Promotional Information: Flat discounts, Cash on Delivery options, and reward points on registration. <br>
* Health Quote: A motivational quote from Hippocrates to inspire trust in our healthcare services. <br>
* Prominent looking 'Sign Up' buttons encouraging users to register and purchase medicines.
